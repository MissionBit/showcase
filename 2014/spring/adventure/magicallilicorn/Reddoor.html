<p>You go through the red door and find yourself outside. You are in a dark, foggy forest and you have no idea where you are. You see the back of a man. You call out to him, asking for help. He turns around, and you see that he has no face. You turn back, horrified. <b><a href="index.html">He follows you with an eerie silence.</b></a> </p>
