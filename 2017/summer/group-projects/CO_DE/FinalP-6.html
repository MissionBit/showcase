  <h3>English Class is one of my favorite subject. </h3>
  <p>I read a lot of books in this class. I didn't really like to read before, but in this class I learned tips to make the reading more interesting, such as making connections, inferences, inferences and predictions in a book. Also, these helped me understand better the books.  </p>

  <h3></h3>
  <p>I am 12th grader at high school, I am planning to go to college. However, I stil can not decide what specific thing I want to study. The only thing I am sure is I want to study things connected to design. Some of my option are: Web Design, Graphic Design or Videogame Design. </p> 
    <p> Since I still have time before going to college, I would like to use this time to experience different things and learn more about the careers and then choose what I really like and what I want to do for my future job.</p>

<div style = "background-color:#8A2BE2;"id="10years" class="tabcontent">
  <h3></h3>
    
      <p>For me success is when I achieve my goals with all the efforts I make. Feeling successful is when I am happy on what I am doing in my career and my life. Therefore, I want to be someone who is happy because of her success in 10 years. </p>
    
    <p> In 10 years I see myself as someone who finished college and became a designer for a company. Someone who achieved many of her goals and wants to set new goals for her life. </p>
    <p>When I already earn enough money, I will travel some part of the world to learn more about cultures and take many photos of those places. This is one of my dream now, hopefully I want to be able to achieve this dream in 10 years. Also, I see myself able to speak well four languages; English, Spanish, Cantonese and Mandarin. I set this goal now and I believe I will achieve this goal in the future.  </p>
