    "The Adventure Game project was one of the first projects in the
    Spring 2014 semester where the students got to flex their creative
    muscles. Building an adventure game in HTML was great motivation
    for many of the students to dig deeper into CSS and gave them
    the opportunity to think about how to structure a site with a
    lot of separate pages."
